class KilloughDrive(RobotDriveBase):
    r"""A class for driving Killough drive platforms.

    Killough drives are triangular with one omni wheel on each corner.

            ---

    Each `drive()` function provides different inverse kinematic relations for a Killough drive.
    The default wheel vectors are parallel to their respective opposite sides, but can be overridden.
    See the constructor for more information.

    This library uses the NED axes convention (North-East-Down as external reference in the world
    frame): http://www.nuclearprojects.com/ins/images/axis_big.png.

    The positive X axis points ahead, the positive Y axis points right, and the positive Z axis
    points down. Rotations follow the right-hand rule, so clockwise rotation around the Z axis is
    positive.
