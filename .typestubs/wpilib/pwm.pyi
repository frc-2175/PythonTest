    """Raw interface to PWM generation in the FPGA.
    
    The values supplied as arguments for PWM outputs range from -1.0 to 1.0. They
    are mapped to the hardware dependent values, in this case 0-2000 for the
    FPGA.  Changes are immediately sent to the FPGA, and the update occurs at
    the next FPGA cycle (5.005 ms). There is no delay.

    As of revision 0.1.10 of the FPGA, the FPGA interprets the 0-2000 values as
    follows:
    
    - 2000 = full "forward"
    - 1999 to 1001 = linear scaling from "full forward" to "center"
    - 1000 = center value
    - 999 to 2 = linear scaling from "center" to "full reverse"
    - 1 = minimum pulse width (currently .5ms)
    - 0 = disabled (i.e. PWM output is held low)
    
    kDefaultPwmPeriod is the 1x period (5.05 ms).  In hardware, the period
    scaling is implemented as an output squelch to get longer periods for old
    devices.

    - 20ms periods (50 Hz) are the "safest" setting in that this works for all
      devices
    - 20ms periods seem to be desirable for Vex Motors
    - 20ms periods are the specified period for HS-322HD servos, but work
      reliably down to 10.0 ms; starting at about 8.5ms, the servo sometimes
      hums and get hot; by 5.0ms the hum is nearly continuous
    - 10ms periods work well for Victor 884
    - 5ms periods allows higher update rates for Luminary Micro Jaguar speed
      controllers. Due to the shipping firmware on the Jaguar, we can't run the
      update period less than 5.05 ms.
