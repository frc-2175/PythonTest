           Note that the SD540 uses the following bounds for PWM values. These
           values should work reasonably well for most controllers, but if users
           experience issues such as asymmetric behavior around the deadband or
           inability to saturate the controller in either direction, calibration is
           recommended. The calibration procedure can be found in the SD540 User
           Manual available from Mindsensors.
